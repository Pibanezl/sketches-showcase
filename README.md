# 🎨 Sketches Showcase — Learning p5.js

This project is a **personal showcase** where I collect and display the exercises and small experiments I create while learning **p5.js**.  
It’s a simple space to explore creative coding, document my progress, and play with generative ideas using **Next.js** + **p5.js**.
